Welcome to my Kubernetes Homelab repository! This project showcases my personal Kubernetes setup used for experimenting, learning, and managing various workloads at home. From deploying services to monitoring and automating tasks, this homelab serves as a playground for improving Kubernetes skills and creating a flexible environment for various use cases.
